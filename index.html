                <div class="card">
                    <p>With hands that built businesses and nurtured both family and feathered creatures, Aubrey Hing began his journey in Georgetown, Guyana on September 16, 1940, born to Alvin and Beryl (Vancooten) Hing. </p>
                    <p>His remarkable life journey came to a close on February 19, 2025, at the age of eighty-four.</p>
                    <p>As one of twelve siblings, Aubrey learned early the values of community and connection that would define his life. These lessons served him well as he built his career as a respected Realtor and entrepreneur, always finding time to spread his wisdom along the way.</p>
                    <p>Together with his beloved wife Pauline, he created a home filled with laughter and fun for their two sons, Mark and Martin. In 1995, Aubrey traded real estate listings for livestock ledgers, devoting his retirement years to his lifelong passion: breeding rare chickens. His extensive knowledge and gentle approach made him a sought-after expert in poultry circles.</p>
                    <p>Those who knew Aubrey speak of a man whose generosity extended far beyond obligation. Whether offering practical help to neighbors or helping the needy, he gave freely of himself and his money without expectation of return.</p>
                    <p>Aubrey's legacy lives on through his wife Pauline; sons Mark (Thea) and Martin (Christine); grandchildren Brock, Grant, Marin, Edward and Rachel; and his eleven siblings: Errol, Ossie, Lynette, Jeanette, Carlton, Elizabeth, Jennifer, Angela, Andrew, David and Ruth -- each carrying forward pieces of his kindness, integrity, and quiet strength.</p>

                        <p>On this day the United States enacted the Selective Training and Service Act, also known as the Burke-Wadsworth Act, which established the first peacetime draft in American history. However it was overshadowed by the birth of <b>James Aubrey Hing</b>.</p>

                        <h3 class="timeline-date">Childhood</h3>
                        <p>Growing up in British Guyana during the 1940s, Aubrey experienced a childhood that flowed with the rhythms of Georgetown's coastal breeze. While war shadows darkened much of the world, this South American colony remained a protected pocket of normality, where air raid sirens and ration books were foreign concepts. Aubrey's days unfolded under sprawling mango trees and along the Demerara River, where he and neighborhood friends played until the sun went down. Weekend afternoons often found him at the Cinema, captivated by the flickering adventures of Hollywood stars, a bag of sweets in hand.</p>

                        <h3 class="timeline-date">England and Marriage</h3>
                        <p>After leaving Guyana, Aubrey relocated to London with his mother and sister in the early 1960s. He quickly arranged for his betrothed, Pauline Vincent, to join him and they married shortly after her arrival. While establishing themselves in a new country, they had two sons, Mark and Martin. Both Aubrey and Pauline secured positions in the British Civil Service, working diligently to provide stability for their family during a time of significant economic and social change in Britain. Their shared commitment to public service and family created a strong foundation as they built their new life in Britain while maintaining connections to their Guyanese heritage.</p>

                        <h3 class="timeline-date">Family Life in Canada</h3>
                        <p>In 1970, seeking new horizons, Aubrey and Pauline made the bold decision to emigrate again -- this time to Canada. They settled in Vancouver, where the Pacific coastline and mountain vistas offered a striking contrast to both Georgetown's tropical terrain and London's urban sprawl.</p>
                            <p>Starting over once more, they pivoted from civil service to real estate, quickly establishing themselves in Vancouver's growing market. Their complementary strengths -- Aubrey's analytical mind and Pauline's natural warmth with clients -- transformed them into a formidable business partnership. As their client list expanded, so did their family's opportunities.</p>
                            <p>Their Vancouver home became a cornerstone for extended family, with nieces and nephews from Guyana and elsewhere staying with them while attending Canadian schools. This quiet generosity helped establish a multi-generational legacy of educational achievement throughout their extended family.</p>

                        <h3 class="timeline-date">Later Years</h3>
                        <p>In 1995, Aubrey retired and dedicated himself to his passion for breeding rare chickens. Despite his daily commitment to this hobby, family remained his priority. Aubrey was consistently present for his sons and grandchildren -- Brock, Grant, Marin, Edward, and Rachel -- attending their various activities and milestones. His reliability became his hallmark; family members knew they could count on him for practical help or simply his supportive presence.</p>

                        <h3 class="timeline-date">Legacy</h3>
                        <p>Aubrey embodied quiet strength and unwavering dedication across three continents. From his childhood in Guyana to building a life in London and finally establishing deep roots in Vancouver, Aubrey consistently prioritized family above all else. His career path, from the British Civil Service to successful realtor, demonstrated his adaptability and work ethic, but his greatest achievement was the stable foundation he created for generations that followed. His life reminds us that true impact lies not in grand gestures but in showing up consistently, offering help without hesitation and creating a sense of belonging for all fortunate enough to know him.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">In the emergency room after his stage IV pancreatic cancer diagnosis, Aubrey sang a hymn to his son Mark -- one he'd composed months earlier. 
                                The melody was entirely new to Mark, but it was so good Mark recorded it on his phone. 
                                When Aubrey finished singing, he simply said, "maybe you can play it at my funeral." Mark nodded and not only played it at his father's funeral, but captured it on this website for posterity.</p>
