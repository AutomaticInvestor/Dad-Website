                <div class="card">
                    <p>With hands that built businesses and nurtured both family and feathered creatures, Aubrey Hing began his journey in Georgetown, Guyana on September 16, 1940, born to Alvin and Beryl (née Vancooten) Hing. </p>
                    <p>His remarkable life journey came to a close on February 19, 2025, at the age of eighty-four.</p>
                    <p>As one of twelve siblings, Aubrey learned early the values of community and connection that would define his life. These lessons served him well as he built his career as a respected Realtor and entrepreneur, always finding time to spread his wisdom along the way.</p>
                    <p>Together with his beloved wife Pauline, he created a home filled with laughter and fun for their two sons, Mark and Martin. In 1995, Aubrey traded real estate listings for livestock ledgers, devoting his retirement years to his lifelong passion: breeding rare chickens. His extensive knowledge and gentle approach made him a sought-after expert in poultry circles.</p>
                    <p>Those who knew Aubrey speak of a man whose generosity extended far beyond obligation. Whether offering practical help to neighbors or giving to the needy, he gave freely of himself without expectation of return.</p>
                    <p>Aubrey's legacy lives on through his wife Pauline; sons Mark (Thea) and Martin (Christine); grandchildren Brock, Grant, Marin, Edward and Rachel; and his eleven siblings: Errol, Ossie, Lynette, Jeanette, Carlton, Elizabeth, Jennifer, Angela, Andrew, David and Ruth -- each carrying forward pieces of his kindness, integrity, and quiet strength.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">In the emergency room after his stage IV pancreatic cancer diagnosis, Aubrey sang a hymn to his son Mark -- one he'd composed months earlier. 
                                The melody was entirely new to Mark, but its thoughtful progression and unexpected turns captured him immediately. 
                                When Aubrey finished singing, he simply said, "Maybe you can play it at my funeral." Mark nodded and not only played it at his father's funeral, but captured it on this website for posterity.</p>
